# Seismometer records of ground tilt induced by debris flows

Jupyter notebook containing code and data to reproduce the results shown in Wenner et al., submitted to BSSA

In this project, we use recordings of broadband seismometers to measure ground tilt caused by the passing of a debris flow.
Seismic data of the Volc√°n de Fuego, Guatemala is not publically available. Addtionally, force plate data of Illgraben is also not publically available.
All other data can be found in the data directory.
